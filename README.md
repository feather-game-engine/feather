# I'm back! Actual development will start again soon. Check out Javinal Charles' [BitAlchemy](https://github.com/JavinalCharles/BitAlchemy) Engine for a game engine.

# Feather Engine

**CURRENTLY IN EARLY ALPHA. THE ENGINE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND BUGS MAY BE VERY COMMON.**

A simple, lightweight, open-source C++ game engine

It currently has full rendering, text, input, sound, and physics systems set up, although it is still in active development, so things may be changed, added, or removed.

## Installing

To use the Feather Engine, WIP

## Developers

This project is developed by me (formerlybased) in my spare time. Feel free to open a PR or make an issue if you wish to contribute!

## Documentation

Documentation is available in the docs/ directory. I may also make a tutorial when I have some time (if you wish to make a tutorial, go ahead and tell me, I will link it here). There is also an example project available in example/

## Building

The project uses cmake as its buildsystem. Install cmake, cd into the build/ directory, and then run cmake ..

## Shipping a game

Shipping a game is still a WIP.

## Planned Features

As features are introduced and planned, they will appear here. Not all features listed here will make it into the final engine, nor will every future feature be listed here. **If you are looking to contribute to development, this could be a good place to start**.

- A more advanced collision / physics system
- Levels (like scenes in other engines)
- A timing system
- Window resizing (game scales with it) & fullscreen windows
- Simple serialization (saving & loading funcs)
- Finished documentation
- Updating the example project to showcase all features.

If you want to suggest a feature, open an issue.
