# Feather Engine

**CURRENTLY IN EARLY ALPHA. THE ENGINE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND BUGS MAY BE VERY COMMON.**

A simple, lightweight, open-source C++ game engine

It currently has full rendering, text, input, sound, and physics systems set up, although it is still in active development, so things may be changed, added, or removed.

## Installing

To use the Feather Engine, WIP

## Developers

This project is developed by me (formerlybased) in my spare time. Feel free to open a PR or make an issue if you wish to contribute!

## Documentation

New documentation is being made for the engine. See the docs/ repository for more information.

## Building

The project uses cmake as its buildsystem. Install cmake, cd into the build/ directory, and then run cmake ..

## Shipping a game

Shipping a game is still a WIP.

## Planned Features

As features are introduced and planned, they will appear here. Not all features listed here will make it into the final engine, nor will every future feature be listed here. **If you are looking to contribute to development, this could be a good place to start**.

- A more advanced collision / physics system
- Some kind of state manager to make managing different scenes/levels easy
- A timing system
- Window resizing (game scales with it) & fullscreen windows
- Simple serialization (saving & loading funcs)
- Finished documentation
- Reworking examples

If you want to suggest a feature, open an issue.
